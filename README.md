# hubbardmodel
hubbardmodel is a Python 3 library for modelling a fermionic Hubbard model square lattice with infinitely strong Coulomb repulsion. 

## Installation

The module is currently designed to be downloaded and manually imported from a file.

## Content

The file hubbard.py contains the main functions of the module. The file plotting.py currently only contains a few simple functions that aid in visual vector display in ASCII.

## Requirements

The project is written in Python 3.8. The module is not tested on lower Python versions and may not work properly. It requires the numpy and scipy modules.

## Usage

The main module is placed in the directory of your project and imported directly. The SquareModel class is the main class for handling the Hubbard model and related computations.

## License

The project is under an MIT license. Please read the LICENSE file for details.
